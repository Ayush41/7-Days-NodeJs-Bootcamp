// DAY 1 ASSIGNMENT 1

// PROBLEM STATEMENT 4:- ARRAYS
// You're organising a party and want to keep track of the guest list. Create an array called "Guest List" and add the names of at least 5 guests. Then, write a program that checks if a given name is on the guestlist. If the name is found, display "welcome to the party.[name]!"; otherwise, display "Sorry, you're not on the guest list."
